# Wallpaper Patterns

An interactive visualization of the 17 wallpaper groups using dynamic motifs. This project demonstrates how different symmetry patterns can be applied to a moving shape to create intricate tessellations.

## What are Wallpaper Groups?

Wallpaper groups are mathematical classifications of repeating patterns that can tile a plane. There are exactly 17 different ways to arrange identical shapes to completely cover a plane while maintaining perfect symmetry. These patterns are created by applying combinations of:

- Translations
- Rotations
- Reflections
- Glide reflections

## Features

- Interactive visualization of all 17 wallpaper patterns
- Dynamic "snake-like" motif that moves randomly
- Real-time pattern generation
- Play/pause controls
- Pattern selection dropdown
